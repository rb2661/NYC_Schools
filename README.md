# NYC Schools
 
A dashboard for visualizing data about NYC High Schools.

This dashboard utilizes data from 4 sources:

1. NYC Department of Education HS Directory
2. 2016-17 NYC Graduation Outcomes by School
3. 2013-2018 NYC Demographic School Snapshots
4. GeoJSON file of NYC Zip Codes

The first 3 files can all be found on NYC Open Data

I chose to utilize pre-pandemic data because I wanted to get a sense of trends without the disruption of that external factor.
